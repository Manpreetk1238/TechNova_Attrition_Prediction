## üìò Project Overview

**TechNova Solutions**, a mid-sized IT services company, has been facing higher-than-average employee turnover.  
The goal of this project is to use data-driven methods to help HR identify employees who are most likely to leave and understand the key factors behind attrition.

## üß© Key Objectives

1. Explore and understand employee-related data.  
2. Clean, preprocess, and visualize key patterns.  
3. Engineer relevant features for modeling.  
4. Train and evaluate predictive models.  
5. Recommend actionable insights for HR teams.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding  
- Import and inspect the dataset.  
- Identify attribute types, missing values, and duplicates.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize trends and relationships.  
- Examine key factors affecting attrition such as salary, performance, and satisfaction.

### 3. Data Preprocessing  
- Handle missing values and categorical variables.  
- Normalize and encode data for machine-learning models.

### 4. Feature Engineering  
- Create new meaningful variables.  
- Drop unnecessary or redundant features.

### 5. Experiment Design  
- Select baseline models and define metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC).

### 6. Data Preparation  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 7. Model Building  
- Implement algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.  
- Train and tune hyperparameters for best results.

### 8. Model Evaluation  
- Compare model performance.  
- Visualize confusion matrix and classification reports.

### 9. Model Explainability  
- Use feature-importance plots and SHAP values to interpret results.

### 10. Recommendations  
- Provide HR with insights to improve employee retention.
